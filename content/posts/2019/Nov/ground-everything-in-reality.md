The mission should be to ground everything in reality. Even the mystical. 

The mystical can remain mysterious while having a footing in the truth. That's the funny thing. Being obscure, complex, or transcendent does not invalidate something's truth. Psychedelics are a great example of a catalyst to the mysterious whose underpinnings are deeply rational and truthful. 

The essence of the psychedelic experience is, well... psychedelic! And it is very mysterious. That is an irrefutable truth. So mystery is irrefutable.
