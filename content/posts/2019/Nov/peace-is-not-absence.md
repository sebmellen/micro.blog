Does peace truly exist? Upon examination of the world around us, we find that everything is vibration. Thus, at a basic level, everything is deeply alive. 

I have commonly associated peace with death, with the absence of something, a space without noise or life. A space which seemed to have more in common with the void than with the Big Bang. But I understand now â€” this was only my misconception, and my search for empty peace is what has made my search unfulfilling. 

Peace is a harmony. An experience of being full with vigor and life. A harmony which allows for true, complete integration with the melody of reality. Peace is not the absence of anything, it is the acceptance of things as they are.
