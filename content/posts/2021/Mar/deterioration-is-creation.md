Deterioration is not the opposite of creation. They are one and the same. New matter cannot form if old matter does not deteriorate, and our illusions of new matter somehow being separate from the old are fallacious and completely invented. 

Are we in the darkness of the gloom  
Or the darkness of the womb? 

It depends on how you look at it.
