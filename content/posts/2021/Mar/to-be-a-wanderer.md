What keeps you nonstop wandering  
Is you think you've got to be a thing  

Sit down, reflect a little while  
Do you recognize your smile?  
To love yourself, you've got to train  
That's you right there, shining plain  

And think in morning light how good  
It is to wander through the wood  
How nice it is to feel the stares  
Of girls with long-grown, colored hairs  

How breathing brings a kind of joy  
The kind in every happy boy  
So freely, untaxed, drink the air  
And blow away your dark despair  

You'll find the world loves you, too  
It loves the little things you do  
They don't go noticed there and then  
But sometime in a different when  
They'll blossom, bloom, and bring you joy  
The universe's karmic ploy  

You see, these plots and sacred lands  
Were shaped by God's almighty hands  
So if you find that you're diseased  
Or if you find yourself unpleased  
Remember all things come in time  
Today they're grapes, tomorrow wine  

But as things come so must they go  
This is the universe's flow  
All around you, it abounds  
From baby cribs to burial grounds  
So don't be sad if loved ones die  
Their souls and spirits fill the sky  

And through your life, as time ticks by  
As moments come and as they fly  
Thank yourself that you're alive  
For you are it, the Godhead. And now it is your time to thrive.
