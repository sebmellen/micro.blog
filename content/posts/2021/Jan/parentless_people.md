Parentless people packaged as products for purchase, with prices set by predatory profiteers pickpocketing the poorly paid payrolls of present-day peasants. Protest is pointless, poverty persists.

Yes the millennial dream, how good does it seem?

Drowning in an electronic media _determined_ to sell you a trip on Expedia, _determined_ **not** to let you pick up an encyclopedia.

Coming from common core, you craft a chart to crawl your course through college â€” you're caught. Committed to the crisis of a crippling career choice.

Now you're a specialized slave, unengaged and paid for the long toil of foggy-brained days.
