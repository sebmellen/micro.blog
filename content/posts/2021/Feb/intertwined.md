It's a rainy night, and you come home to see  
A phone lying still on the windowsill  
A dial tone still trilling while the face  
Of your lover lies dappled in the beams of neon streetlights  
Squeezing their ways through cracks in the blinds  
To caress the lips and contours of that lovely face.  
You whisper hello, and _quiet_, make your way across the room  
Tiptoeing and undressing an inch at a time, staying slow  
So you can listen to her breath and keep the one you love asleep.  
And then you're freed of all the horrors of the day â€”  
They slip away into the night, it's only right  
This is the time you can be free.  
So you caress and cuddle up against her chest  
Staying warm within that nest, and sharing heat  
You're both undressed and you repeat  
The deeper rhythms of her breath  
So that you too can get some rest.  
Dreams begin to trickle through your thoughts  
And as they flood your tired mind  
You realize you are intertwined  
With your soulmate  
And there is no better fate.  
You dream a dream that's just for you  
But from the smile on your face  
I'm sure you're dreaming that the two  
Of you are going on a date.
